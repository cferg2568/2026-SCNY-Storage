# SCNY Region — A Drought-Conditioned Look at Groundwater Storage

**DRAFT.** A groundwater-storage briefing for the SCNY region, prepared by
Larry Walker Associates. It replicates the methodology of the Vina Subbasin
storage dashboard, adapted to a **four-zone** framework (CCWD, RD108,
Dunnigan, and the SCNY residual "Other" area).

> **Placeholder constants.** The headline *denominators* — sustainable yield
> and total fresh groundwater in storage — are **placeholders** pending a
> defensible SCNY-footprint basis (see [Headline constants](#headline-constants)).
> They are context only; the volumetric storage-change results (AF and AF/yr)
> do **not** depend on them.

## Two polygon methods, one dashboard

A toggle at the top switches between two ways of turning the 27 RMS wells
into storage-accounting polygons. The wells are the same in both; only the
polygon shapes (and therefore the area-weighted storage attribution) differ.

| Method | How polygons are built | Cells cross zone lines? |
|---|---|---|
| **Single region-wide tessellation** | One Voronoi tessellation across all 27 RMS wells, clipped to the SCNY region boundary | Yes |
| **Four-zone (per management area)** | Four independent Voronoi tessellations — one per zone (CCWD, RD108, Dunnigan, Other) — each clipped to its own zone boundary | No — hard seams at zone lines |

The four-zone method is the more SMC-defensible framework: a polygon's
hydrology rolls up to the zone where the well physically sits rather than
across boundaries. A zone with a single RMS well (**Dunnigan**, 1 well)
is represented as one dissolved polygon equal to the whole zone boundary.

### Zones and polygon counts

| Zone | Single | Four-zone | Area (acres) |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| CCWD (Colusa County WD) | 6 | 6 | 45,765 |
| RD108 (Reclamation District 108) | 7 | 7 | 58,714 |
| Dunnigan (Dunnigan WD) | 1 | 1 (aggregate) | 10,421 |
| Other (SCNY residual) | 13 | 13 | 182,058 |
| **SCNY total** | **27** | **27** | **296,958** |

## The two questions this dashboard answers

> **When and where is the region losing water, and what would it take to hold
> the line?**

## Headline finding (first draft, WY 1999–2025)

Loss is concentrated in drought years, not uniform. Two region totals (see
[normalization](#year-type-weighted-normalization) for why both):

| Metric | Single | Four-zone |
|---|--:|--:|
| Region net observed (AF) | −342,376 | −353,193 |
| Region net normalized (AF) | −336,518 | −321,098 |
| Observed avg loss rate (AF/yr) | 16,265 | 16,573 |
| Normalized avg loss rate (AF/yr) | 12,943 | 12,350 |

Storage change by Sacramento Valley Index water-year type (single method):

| Condition | Years | Total ΔStorage (AF) | Avg per year |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| Wet | 5 | **+229,218** | +45,844 |
| Above Normal | 5 | **+129,856** | +25,971 |
| Below Normal | 5 | **−137,809** | −27,562 |
| Dry | 6 | **−247,728** | −41,288 |
| Critical | 5 | **−315,914** | −63,183 |
| Region net (WY 2000–2025) | 26 | **−342,376** | — |

Year-type classification uses DWR's official **Sacramento Valley Index**
(Northern Sierra 8-Station Index).

## Method, in brief

- **Storage:** ΔStorage<sub>p,y</sub> = (GWE<sub>p,y</sub> − GWE<sub>p,baseline</sub>) × Sy<sub>p</sub> × Area<sub>p</sub>.
- **GWE:** spring composite (March mean, Good-quality DWR records only) of the
  polygon's RMS well. Each polygon is baseline-anchored to the first WY
  1999–2025 year with a Good March measurement.
- **Specific yield:** polygon-by-polygon, from DWR's SVSim Texture Data
  (Sacramento Valley Simulation Model). Coarse-grained sediments → 0.15,
  fine-grained → 0.05, area-weighted by borehole lithology in the 0–500 ft
  below-ground analysis window (≥200 ft of valid lithology required per
  borehole). All 27 SCNY polygons resolve to a real SVSim value (no
  fallbacks); Sy ranges **0.056 to 0.099**.
- **Area:** computed in EPSG:3310 (NAD-83 California Albers, equal-area),
  honoring holes and multipart geometry. Storage is computed over the
  `no_rangeland` SCNY footprint (296,958 ac).
- **Gap attribution:** multi-year gaps in a polygon's Good measurements are
  distributed evenly across the missing years and bucketed by each year's
  hydrologic condition.

## Year-type-weighted normalization

Not every polygon has a Good March measurement in WY 1999; several baseline
later (or end their record early), so the raw **observed** region cumulative
*understates* the deficit — late/short-record polygons can't register their
full drawdown. The **normalized** series corrects this: for each polygon we
compute an average ΔStorage rate *per SVI year type* using only that
polygon's own observations, then apply those per-type rates to the region's
full WY 2000–2025 year-type mix (5 Wet, 5 Above Normal, 5 Below Normal,
6 Dry, 5 Critical = 26 transition years). Each polygon uses only its own
data — no proxying from neighbors, no model fill.

## Headline constants

Two numbers frame the deficit but do **not** enter the storage math:

| Constant | Draft placeholder | Real basis needed |
|---|--:|---|
| Sustainable yield (AF/yr) | 200,000 | SCNY-footprint yield (no published sub-region value) |
| Total fresh GW in storage | 10 MAF | Colusa Subbasin GSP reports 26–140 MAF over the whole 723,823-ac subbasin; SCNY is ~297k ac of that — needs area-scaling or a project figure |

Sustainable yield is used only to express rates as a percent of yield. Total
storage is used only in the "how big is the deficit relative to total
storage" proportion figure. Swap real figures + a GSP citation before this
goes external.

## Project portfolio

Not yet loaded. Add `data/project_portfolio.json` (per-well AF/yr recharge /
conjunctive-use allocations) and rebuild to populate the 2042 hold-the-line
framing and per-polygon net-coverage map. Until then, recovery margins read
as pure deficit.
